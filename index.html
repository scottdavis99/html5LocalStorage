		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>
			Two major new features of HTML5 - application cache and local storage - allow you to bring the web experience to your users, even when the web isn't there. Application cache allows you to write fully functional web applications that work offline as well as online. Local storage allows you to store megabytes of data locally without having to install a separate database. Combine these two features, and you can begin writing web applications for mobile devices (iPhone, iPad, and Android) that behave like native applications - right down to the icon on the desktop.
		</p>

		<p>
			But don't think that these features only work for mobile web development. They are available on PC-based web browsers as well...
